# QuickCuts

About Project:
Website where users can get haircuts by meeting up with local barbers (instead of going to shops). Users can also apply to become a barber and offer their own services/set their own prices.

Tech Used:
Ruby on Rails, TailwindCSS and Postgres


Registration + Sessions were created with the devise gem

Active storage was used to handle image uploads for
creating listings

Most difficult part of this project was definitely the image handling - displaying, resizing, validating, etc.
